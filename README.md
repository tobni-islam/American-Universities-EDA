# American-Universities-EDA
The goal of this project was to find out which are the most relevant features that students take into account to choose the favorite university, besides a high-academic ranking. Some of the essential questions for developing this project are related to the number of applications, admissions, and enrollments, cost of tuition and fees, cost of living on campus, types of degrees offered, and features of the states where universities are located (population and GDP).

The data set used for this analysis was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/sumithbhongale/american-university-data-ipeds-dataset. It contains a plethora of information about American universities (that are not necessarily the top 10â€“20) in 2013. Although this data set does not contain information about all the first-ranked American universities, the patterns and insights extracted from it are highly representative of the whole behavior.

The tools for data analysis used in this project are the packages Numpy and Pandas, and to visualize and explore the data: Matplotlib and Seaborn.
