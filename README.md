# American-Universities-EDA
Welcome to my exploratory data analysis project! This repository showcases my journey as a data analysis learner, where I apply my newly acquired skills in data cleaning, data manipulation, and data visualization. In this project, I have taken a dataset and explored it to gain insights, answer questions, and present my findings through various visualizations.

**Project Overview**

**Objective:** The goal of this project was to find out which are the most relevant features that students take into account to choose the favorite university, besides a high-academic ranking. Some of the essential questions for developing this project are related to the number of applications, admissions, and enrollments, cost of tuition and fees, cost of living on campus, types of degrees offered, and features of the states where universities are located (population).

**Dataset:** The data set used for this analysis was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/sumithbhongale/american-university-data-ipeds-dataset.this data set does not contain information about all the first-ranked American universities, the patterns and insights extracted from it are highly representative of the whole behavior.

**Tools and Libraries:** The tools for data analysis used in this project are the packages Numpy and Pandas, and to visualize and explore the data: Matplotlib and Seaborn.



**Key Findings**

Throughout the analysis, I've made several interesting findings and visualizations. Some of the key insights include:

* A high number of applications does not imply that a university is preferred among students.

* Students do not necessarily prefer a university because of its high acceptance rate or, in other words, the students’ preference is not based on how easy it is for them to be admitted to a university.

* There is a strong students’ preference for public universities.

* Two of the main reasons why public universities are preferred by students are: first, on average public universities present more affordable tuition and fees than private universities; second, public universities have more affordable on-campus living costs.

* Students, in general, prefer universities with affordable costs of on-campus living.

* When students look for a university to study for a Bachelor’s degree, they do not frequently choose the university thinking about a future possibility of pursuing a higher degree at the same university
